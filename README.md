# Description
Internationally, COVID-19 is spreading and has a high mortality rate. As a result, the WHO(World Health Organization) classified it as a pandemic. A rapid and correct diagnosis is necessary to reduce illness transmission. To recognize the illness, a converse record polymerase chain response (RT-PCR) test is oftentimes performed. In any case, since this test takes time, a chest registered tomography (CT) or plain chest X-Ray (CXR) is sporadically suggested. These are regarded problems, and a convolutional neural network will be built to replace these loops. Thus, we recommend a plan for making Artificial Intelligence calculations for COVID-19 discovery and ID that further develop the order capacity of COVID-19 cases. Rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 symptoms is the need of the hour and to this end, automated diagnosis has been preferred over manual diagnostic methodologies to effectively identify and combat the virus.
